# Hedge Cop: Quills of Vengeance - Development Milestones

**Project**: HTML5 Side-scrolling Beat-em-up Game  
**Reference**: See `_PRD.md` for complete requirements and `_Human.md` for collaboration guidelines

## Overview
This document breaks down the development of Hedge Cop: Quills of Vengeance into 12 manageable milestones, following a progressive approach from core mechanics to full game completion.

## Status Tracking Instructions
**When completing each milestone, update the status section below with:**
- Completion date
- Key achievements/notes
- Any deviations from plan
- Lessons learned for next milestone

**Before starting each new milestone (except Milestone 1):**
1. Create a new folder in the `Archive/` directory named after the previous milestone (e.g., `Milestone-1/`, `Milestone-2/`, etc.)
2. Copy all existing `.html`, `.css`, and `.js` files into this archive folder
3. This preserves the working state from the previous milestone before making new changes

2. Combat system foundation (Milestone 3)
3. First playable level (Milestone 5)
4. Full enemy roster (Milestone 7)
5. Complete level progression (Milestones 8, 10)
6. Final polish and testing (Milestone 12)

### Success Metrics
- 60 FPS performance maintained throughout development
- Cross-browser compatibility achieved by Milestone 8
