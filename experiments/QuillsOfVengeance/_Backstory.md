# Hedge Cop: Quills of Vengeance - Backstory

## Main Character: Detective Hedge Cop

### Origin
Detective Hedge Cop wasn't always the spiky vigilante patrolling Hong Kong's neon-lit streets. Born as Detective Marcus "Spike" Chen, he was once the HKPF's most decorated officer, known for his unwavering sense of justice and ability to get into the tightest spots during investigations.

### The Transformation
During a botched raid on a Triad laboratory in 1993, Detective Chen was exposed to an experimental bioweapon designed to create super-soldiers. The chemical cocktail, derived from rare hedgehog DNA and illegal enhancement serums, should have killed him. Instead, it transformed him into something unprecedented - a man with the defensive capabilities and instincts of a hedgehog, but retaining his human intelligence and moral compass.

### The New Reality
Now possessing the ability to curl into a defensive ball, shoot quills as projectiles, and sense danger with supernatural awareness, Detective Chen adopted the moniker "Hedge Cop." His transformation made him an outcast from the regular police force, but also gave him the unique abilities needed to take on Hong Kong's most dangerous criminal organizations.

## The Antagonist: The Red Dragon Triad

### The Organization
The Red Dragon Triad has controlled Hong Kong's underground for decades, but in the 1990s, they've become more ambitious and more dangerous. Led by the mysterious Dragon Head known only as "The Crimson Fang," they've expanded beyond traditional organized crime into biochemical weapons, human trafficking, and international terrorism.

### The Personal Vendetta
The same laboratory accident that created Hedge Cop also killed his partner, Detective Sarah Liu, and left dozens of innocent civilians permanently affected by the experimental toxins. The Red Dragon Triad was behind the illegal research, using kidnapped scientists and stolen government funding to develop their bioweapons program.

### Current Threat
Now, the Red Dragon Triad is preparing to release their perfected bioweapon across Hong Kong's water supply, threatening millions of lives. They've grown bold, operating in broad daylight and corrupting officials at every level of government. Traditional law enforcement is powerless against their influence and resources.

## The Setting: 1990s Hong Kong

### The City
Hong Kong in the 1990s is a city caught between worlds - British colonial rule is ending, the handover to China looms on the horizon, and the city's identity is in flux. This uncertainty has created perfect conditions for organized crime to flourish, with various factions fighting for control of the lucrative criminal enterprises.

### The Atmosphere
Neon signs reflect off rain-slicked streets, crowded markets bustle with activity hiding illegal deals, and towering skyscrapers cast long shadows over ancient temples. The city never sleeps, and danger lurks around every corner - from the bustling street markets of Mong Kok to the exclusive gambling dens hidden in luxury hotels.

### Law Enforcement Crisis
The Hong Kong Police Force is stretched thin and riddled with corruption. Many officers are on the Triad payroll, and those who aren't often find themselves outgunned and outnumbered. This is why Hedge Cop operates alone - he can't trust anyone within the system, and his unique abilities make him a one-man army against impossible odds.

## The Quest for Justice

### Personal Mission
Hedge Cop's mission isn't just about stopping the Red Dragon Triad's latest scheme. It's about avenging his fallen partner, protecting the innocent civilians who can't protect themselves, and proving that justice can prevail even when the system fails.

### The Countdown
Intelligence suggests the Triad plans to execute their bioweapon attack during the upcoming Mid-Autumn Festival, when millions of people will be gathered in public spaces across the city. Hedge Cop has only days to fight his way through the Triad's hierarchy, from street-level enforcers to the Dragon Head himself.

### Stakes
Failure means not just his own death, but the potential transformation or death of millions of Hong Kong citizens. Success means finally bringing down the organization that destroyed his life and ensuring the city's safety as it enters this crucial period of transition.

This is more than just a beat-em-up adventure - it's a fight for the soul of Hong Kong itself.
