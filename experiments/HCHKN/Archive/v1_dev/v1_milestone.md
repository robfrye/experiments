# Development Milestones
## Hedge Cop: Hong Kong Nights

### Overview
This document breaks down the development of the hedgehog detective platformer into manageable milestones. Each milestone represents a key development phase with specific deliverables and acceptance criteria.

**üìù Progress Tracking Instructions:**
After completing each milestone, update the `Progress.md` file with:
- Milestone status (Not started, Complete, Problems)
- Completion date
- Notes about implementation or issues encountered
- Next steps or blockers

**üìÅ File Archiving Instructions:**
Before starting each milestone (except Milestone 1), archive the current working files:
1. Create an `Archive` folder in the project root if it doesn't exist
2. Create a subfolder named `Milestone-X` (where X is the previous milestone number)
3. Copy the current `index.html`, `style.css`, and `script.js` files into the milestone subfolder
4. Continue development with the files in the root directory

**Example Archive Structure:**
```
/game
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Archive/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Milestone-1/
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html
